# niconicomments-convert(tmp)
[[日本語](https://github.com/xpadev-net/niconicomments-convert/blob/master/README.md)]


A simple tool to export videos using niconicomments.  
I made it up as I went along, so if you get an error, start it up again and try again.

## Notes
- I will not be held responsible for any damage that may occur.
- Conversion takes so long!
